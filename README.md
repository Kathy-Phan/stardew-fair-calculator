Next project?:
https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Preserves_Jar 
- want to know whats profitable for preserves jar only
- amaranth costs 150g to grow
    - preserved amaranth sells for 350g so profit is 350 - 150 = 200g profit
    - categorise by season
    - factor in crops that grow multiple times e.g. corn vs cauliflower

* VERY ADVANCED - filter checkboxes
    * what season user is at e.g. fall year 1 means no winter stuff
    * check if user has coops/barn e.g. no barn means no cow so no milk
